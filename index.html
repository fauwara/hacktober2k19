                    <p>The Department of Computer Science & Engineering started in the year 2007 with an intake of 60 and is a fast growing discipline and is full of rigorous practical analysis. The department is planning to grow in supersonic speed as far as Technical expertise; Faculty Strength, Modern Teaching Aids, Browsing facilities etc. are concerned. The department also interacts with the industries on a regular basis to develop the capabilities in the latest technologies. The department has setup the state of the art laboratories with computing facilities and peripheral devices.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The department has an intake of 180 students in UG (B. E.) category. It also offers a PG Course i.e. M. Tech. in Computer Science & Engineering with an intake of 24. With highly talented faculty, the department boasts of a unique mode of learning, one that uses advanced aids for teaching. Our faculty and students are actively involved in intense interactions that help our students gain practical exposure, much before they are part of the IT industry. Simulated projects and many times, live projects, give our students the thrill of livewire action of the software industry. And beyond the technology side of Computer Science, our curriculum focuses on the behavioral aspects and management perspectives of the Information Technology.</p>
